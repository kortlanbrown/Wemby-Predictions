NBA Rookie-to-Career Performance Prediction
Predicts long-term NBA career performance using rookie-season statistics to understand how early performance indicators translate into future production.
🔍 Problem
Determine whether rookie-season performance metrics can predict a player’s long-term NBA career averages, and apply the model to estimate Victor Wembanyama’s projected career production.
🧠 Approach
Used historical NBA player data
Cleaned and filtered to include regular-season performance only
Engineered rookie and career per-game features (PPG, REB, AST, BLK, STL)
Built feature matrices and targets
Trained and compared multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Selected the best-performing model and generated Wembanyama career projections
📊 Results
Achieved strong predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.80)
Produced projected career averages for Victor Wembanyama
Created a cleaned dataset suitable for further visualization or comparison analysis
